<p> Living with a total of 8 guys under one roof during my undergraduate studies proved to be equally fun and overwhelming at times, so to mitigate the confusion and pain of splitting bills and expenses I developed this utility. It is built primarily with HTML and CSS, and relies on JavaScript to automatically place Amazon orders and / or add purchases to a split expense report in Google Sheets.
