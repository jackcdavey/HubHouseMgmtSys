## Amazon Gifts

This is a node script that uses selenium-webdriver to purchase yourself a single, $0.50 Amazon gift card.

## To Use

Once you clone this repo, you will need to run `npm install`.

Also, you will need to set up two environment variables.  One is `AMAZON_USERNAME` which is the email address of your Amazon account and the other is... you guessed it... `AMAZON_PASSWORD`.

Once you have done that, simply use node to run `buy_card.js` and away it goes.
